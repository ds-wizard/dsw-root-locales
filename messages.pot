"Before you decide to embark on any new study, it is good practice to check all options to re-use existing available data, either collected or generated by yourself in an earlier project, or data from others (Barend Mons calls this \"Other PEople's Data And Services\" or OPEDAS). This can include reusable data that have been created for an earlier study, and also so-called \"reference data\" which is used by many projects.\n"

"It is not because we can generate massive amounts of data that we always need to do so. Creating data with public money is bringing with it the responsibility to treat those data well and (if potentially useful) make them available for re-use by others.

"[Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) (8): *“**‘processor’** means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.”* Examples of this is if you use a secure computing environment provided by another organisation to do your analysis or to store the data, along with several other scenarios. In the case that you do, there needs to be a legal agreement established between the controller(s) and processor(s) as defined in [Article 28](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-28-gdpr/) (3): *“Processing by a processor shall be governed by a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law, that is binding on the processor with regard to the controller and that sets out the subject-matter and duration of the processing, the nature and purpose of the processing, the type of personal data and categories of data subjects and the obligations and rights of the controller. […]”* Article 28 also lists the required contents of such an agreement. Your organisation and/or the processor organisation will probably have agreement templates that you can use."

msgid "[Article 4](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/) (7): *“**‘controller’** means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, **determines the purposes** and means of the processing of personal data; […].”* The Controller is typically the university employer of the PI, and the PI should act as a representative of her university employer and is responsible for ensuring that personal data is handled correctly in her projects. For cross-border collaborative projects the controllers of different datasets should be identified. Also, if joint controllership is considered, make sure that all parties understand their obligations, and it is probably good to define the terms for this in an agreement between the parties."
